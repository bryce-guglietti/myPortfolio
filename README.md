# myPortfolio

## About
This is a React Portolio to showcase my projects, design abilities, and who I am!

It has the ability to be updated remotely for when I add a new project or skill.

## What was used
I used JavaScript XML and SCSS to achieve this project.

Sanity: to update the elements of the portfolio the backend is handled by Sanity. 

Sanity creates the ability to add, remove, or edit current elements within the application.
